if you can't find the flask app on windows, try setting it with:
`set $env:FLASK_APP="demo.py"`
`set $env:FLASK_ENV="development"`
not sure what's going on here. worked the first day, didn't the second (maybe forgot to launch pycharm as admin?).


## To Do
- figure out why python-dotenv is not working
- improve styles (got completely sidetracked by this \*facepalm*)
- make it flexible regarding different compounding periods and deposits
- error handling
- translate to pt-br

## Status after Chapter 2 (days 1-4)
- lost a lot of time trying to run flask with windows, still not sure what's going on and why dotenv doesn't work
- lost a lot of time with navbar and styles without any improvement
- the calculation itself was wrong on day 3, but it was quite easy on day 4 after I found some good examples
- will probably continue working on this
